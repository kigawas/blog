Personal blog powered by Jekyll.

The theme is made based on the awesome template designed by [HTML5UP](http://html5up.net/striped).

## How to use

Just fork, delete all the posts in `_posts` and update your site information in `_config.yml`, and you may also edit `About.md` to add your own information and `CNAME` to link to your own domain.

Also, choose another logo by substitute `favicon.ico`.

If you want to customize CSS, edit `/assets/css/main.scss`.

A simple code sample:

```css
.article{
  ol, ul{
    padding-left: 2em;
  }
  ol{
    list-style: hiragana-iroha;
  }
  ul{
    list-style-type: disc;
  }
}
```

Last but not least, say thanks to [HTML5UP](http://html5up.net/striped).
